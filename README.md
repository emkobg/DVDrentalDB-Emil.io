## __Emilio's BIG Idea__
I was tasked with creating a lite version of a workflow for a dvdrental database. The workflow is to ease the use for a data warehousing issue easy. The modern ETL stack is often inundated with packages that require massive amounts of setup, configuration and endless black holes of documentation before a solution can be developed.

## __Emilio's Structure__
This structure is still under construction
